                    The HTML <b>"h1–h6"</b> elements represent six levels of section headings. <b>"h1"</b> is the highest section level and <b>"h6"</b> is the lowest.
            </td>
            <td>
                    The HTML <b>"p"</b> element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
            </td>
            <td>
                    The HTML <b>"br"</b> element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
            </td>
            <td>
                    The HTML <b>"em"</b> element marks text that has stress emphasis. The <b>"em"</b> element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.
            </td>
            <td>
                    The HTML <strong> Importance Element ("strong")</strong> indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
            </td>
            <td>
                    The HTML <b>Bring Attention To element ("b")</b>  is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b>"b"</b> for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the <b>"strong"</b> element to indicate that text is of special importance.
            </td>
            <td>
                    The HTML Mark Text element <b>("mark")</b> represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes, due to the marked passage's relevance or importance in the enclosing context.
            </td>
            <td>The HTML Subscript element <b>("sub")</b> specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.</td>
            <td>The HTML Superscript element <b>("sup")</b> specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.</td>
            <td>
                    <b>The HTML "small" element</b>T makes the text font size one size smaller (for example, from large to medium, or from small to x-small) down to the browser's minimum font size.  In HTML5, this element is repurposed to represent side-comments and small print, including copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation.

                <b>Use the combination of "&"+"copy"+ ";"</b> to represent the &copy; sign in the HTML document            </td>

                <b>Use the combination of "&"+"hearts"+";"</b> to place a heart logo the your html doc. Other emojis are also available under <h4 align="center"><a href=https://gist.github.com/oliveratgithub/0bf11a9aff0d6da7b46f1490f86a71eb> This link</a></h4>
            </td>
            <td><b>The HTML "blockquote" Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element)</b> indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <b>"cite"</b> element.</td>
            <td>The HTML <b>"address"</b> element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.</td>
            <td><b>The HTML "q" element</b> indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the <b>"blockquote" </b>element.</td>
            <td><b>The HTML "a" element</b> (or anchor element) creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL.</td>
            <td><b>The HTML Abbreviation element ("abbr")</b> represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional title attribute can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else.</td>
            <td><b>The HTML Bidirectional Text Override element ("bdo")</b> overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.</td>
            <td><b>The HTML "ol" element</b> represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a numbered list.</td>
            <td><b>The HTML "ul" element</b> represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.</td>
            <td><b>The HTML "table" element</b> represents tabular data — that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.</td>

        <td>download HTML5 <br>
                This attribute instructs browsers to download a URL instead of navigating to it, so the user will be prompted to save it as a local file. If the attribute has a value, it is used as the pre-filled file name in the Save prompt (the user can still change the file name if they want). There are no restrictions on allowed values, though / and \ are converted to underscores. Most file systems limit some punctuation in file names, and browsers will adjust the suggested name accordingly. <br>
                href <br>
                Contains a URL or a URL fragment that the hyperlink points to.
                A URL fragment is a name preceded by a hash mark (#), which specifies an internal target location (an id of an HTML element) within the current document. URLs are not restricted to Web (HTTP)-based documents, but can use any protocol supported by the browser. For example, file:, ftp:, and mailto: work in most browsers. <br>
                hreflang <br>
This attribute indicates the human language of the linked resource. It is purely advisory, with no built-in functionality. Allowed values are determined by BCP47. <br>
ping <br>
Contains a space-separated list of URLs to which, when the hyperlink is followed, POST requests with the body PING will be sent by the browser (in the background). Typically used for tracking. <br>
referrerpolicy <br>
Indicates which referrer to send when fetching the URL:
<ol>
<li>'no-referrer' means the Referer: header will not be sent.</li>
<li>
        'no-referrer-when-downgrade' means no Referer: header will be sent when navigating to an origin without HTTPS. This is the default behavior.</li>
<li>'origin' means the referrer will be the origin of the page, not including information after the domain.</li>
<li>'origin-when-cross-origin' meaning that navigations to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host and the port, while navigations on the same origin will include the referrer's path.</li>
<li>'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'</li>
<li>'unsafe-url' means the referrer will include the origin and path, but not the fragment, password, or username. This is unsafe because it can leak data from secure URLs to insecure ones.</li>
</ol>
rel <br>
Specifies the relationship of the target object to the link object. The value is a space-separated list of link types. <br>
target <br>
Specifies where to display the linked URL. It is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context: a tab, window, or "iframe". The following keywords have special meanings:
<ul>
    <li>_self: Load the URL into the same browsing context as the current one. This is the default behavior.</li>
    <li>_blank: Load the URL into a new browsing context. This is usually a tab, but users can configure browsers to use new windows instead.</li>
    <li>_parent: Load the URL into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this behaves the same way as _self.</li>
    <li>_top: Load the URL into the top-level browsing context (that is, the "highest" browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this behaves the same way as _self.</li>
</ul>

Note: When using target, consider adding rel="noreferrer" to avoid exploitation of the window.opener API. <br>

Note: Linking to another page using target="_blank" will run the new page on the same process as your page. If the new page is executing expensive JS, your page's performance may suffer. To avoid this use rel="noopener". <br>

type <br>
Specifies the media type in the form of a MIME type for the linked URL. It is purely advisory, with no built-in functionality. <br>
Obsolete attributesSection <br>
charsetObsolete since HTML5 <br>
This attribute defined the character encoding of the linked URL. The value should be a space- and/or comma-delimited list of character sets defined in RFC 2045. The default value is ISO-8859-1. <br>
Usage note: This attribute is obsolete in HTML5 and should not be used by authors. To achieve its effect, use the HTTP Content-Type: header on the linked URL. <br>

coordsHTML 4 onlyObsolete since HTML5 <br>
For use with the below shape attribute, this attribute used a comma-separated list of numbers to define the coordinates of the link on the page. <br>
nameHTML 4 onlyObsolete since HTML5 <br>
This attribute was required for anchors defining a possible target location within a page. In HTML 4.01, id and name could be used simultaneously on a "a" element as long as they have identical values. <br>
Usage note: This attribute is obsolete in HTML5, use the global attribute id instead. <br>

revHTML 4 onlyObsolete since HTML5 <br>
This attribute specified a reverse link, the inverse relationship of the rel attribute. It was deprecated for being very confusing. <br>
Note: Currently the W3C HTML 5.2 spec states that rev is no longer obsolete, whereas the WHATWG living standard still has it labeled obsolete. Until this discrepancy is resolved, you should still assume it is obsolete. <br>
shapeHTML 4 onlyObsolete since HTML5 <br>
This attribute was used to define a region for hyperlinks to create an image map. The values are circle, default, polygon, and rect. The format of the coords attribute depends on the value of shape. For circle, the value is x,y,r where x and y are the pixel coordinates for the center of the circle and r is the radius value in pixels. For rect, the coords attribute should be x,y,w,h. The x,y values define the upper-left-hand corner of the rectangle, while w and h define the width and height respectively. A value of polygon for shape requires x1,y1,x2,y2,... values for coords. Each of the x,y pairs defines a point in the polygon, with successive points being joined by straight lines and the last point joined to the first. The value default for shape requires that the entire enclosed area, typically an image, be used. <br>
Note: Use the usemap attribute for the "img" element and the associated "map" element to define hotspots instead of the shape attribute.
            </td>
        <td>This element only supports the global attributes. The title attribute has a specific semantic meaning when used with the "abbr" element; it must contain a full human-readable description or expansion of the abbreviation. This text is often presented by browsers as a tooltip when the mouse cursor is hovered over the element.</td>
        <td>dir
                The direction in which text should be rendered in this element's contents. Possible values are:
                <ul>
                    <li>ltr: Indicates that the text should go in a left-to-right direction.</li>
                    <li>rtl: Indicates that the text should go in a right-to-left direction.</li>
                </ul>
                </td>
        <td><mark>compact</mark>  <br>
            This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a compact style. The interpretation of this attribute depends on the user agent and it doesn't work in all browsers.
            Warning: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: the "ol" element should be styled using CSS. To give an effect similar to the compact attribute, the CSS property line-height can be used with a value of 80%. <br>
            
            <mark>reversed HTML5</mark>reversed HTML5
            This Boolean attribute specifies that the items of the list are specified in reversed order. <br>
            <mark>start HTML5</mark> <br>
            This integer attribute specifies the start value for numbering the individual list items. Although the ordering type of list elements might be Roman numerals, such as XXXI, or letters, the value of start is always represented as a number. To start numbering elements from the letter "C", use "ol start="3". <br>
            Note: This attribute was deprecated in HTML4, but reintroduced in HTML5. <br>
            
            <mark>type</mark>
            Indicates the numbering type:
            <ul>
            <li>'a' indicates lowercase letters,</li>
            <li>'A' indicates uppercase letters,</li>
            <li> 'i' indicates lowercase Roman numerals,</li>
            <li>'I' indicates uppercase Roman numerals,</li>
            <li>and '1' indicates numbers (default).</li>
        </ul>
            The type set is used for the entire list unless a different type attribute is used within an enclosed "li" element. <br>
            
            Note: This attribute was deprecated in HTML4, but reintroduced in HTML5. <br>
            
            Unless the value of the list number matters (e.g. in legal or technical documents where items are to be referenced by their number/letter), the CSS list-style-type property should be used instead.

            <mark>compact</mark> <br>
                This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a compact style. The interpretation of this attribute depends on the user agent and it doesn't work in all browsers. <br>
                Usage note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: the "ul" element should be styled using CSS. To give a similar effect as the compact attribute, the CSS property line-height can be used with a value of 80%. <br>
                <mark>type</mark> <br>
                Used to set the bullet style for the list. The values defined under HTML3.2 and the transitional version of HTML 4.0/4.01 are:
                <ul>
                    <li>circle,</li>
                    <li>disc,</li>

                A fourth bullet type has been defined in the WebTV interface, but not all browsers support it: triangle. <br>
                
                If not present and if no CSS list-style-type property does apply to the element, the user agent decide to use a kind of bullets depending on the nesting level of the list. <br>
                
                Usage note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated; use the CSS list-style-type property instead.</td>

        <td><mark>align </mark> <br>
                This enumerated attribute indicates how the table must be aligned inside the containing document. It may have the following values:
                <ul>
                    <li>left: the table is displayed on the left side of the document;</li>
                    <li>center: the table is displayed in the center of the document;</li>
                    <li>right: the table is displayed on the right side of the document.</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                
                <mark>Usage Note</mark> <br>
                Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. The "table" element should be styled using CSS. Set margin-left and margin-right to auto or margin to 0 auto to achieve an effect that is similar to the align attribute. <br>
                Prior to Firefox 4, Firefox also supported the middle, absmiddle, and abscenter values as synonyms of center, in quirks mode only. <br>
                <mark>bgcolor</mark> <br>
                This attribute defines the background color of a table. It consists of a 6-digit hexadecimal code as defined in sRGB and is prefixed by '#'. This attribute may be used with one of sixteen predefined color strings:

                Usage note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. The "table" element should be styled using CSS. Use the background-color property in CSS to create an effect that is similar to the bgcolor attribute. <br>
                <mark>border </mark> <br>
                This integer attribute defines, in pixels, the size of the frame surrounding the table. If set to 0, the frame attribute is set to void. <br>
                Usage note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. The "table" element should be styled using CSS. To create an effect similar to the border attribute, the border, border-color, border-width and border-style CSS properties should be used. <br>
                <mark>cellpadding </mark> <br>
                This attribute defines the space between the content of a cell and its border, displayed or not. If the cellpadding's length is defined in pixels, this pixel-sized space will be applied to all four sides of the cell's content. If the length is defined using a percentage value, the content will be centered and the total vertical space (top and bottom) will represent this value. The same is true for the total horizontal space (left and right). <br>
                Usage note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. The "table" element should be styled using CSS. To create an effect similar to the cellpadding attribute, apply the border-collapse property to the "table" element, with its value set to collapse, and the padding property to the "td" element. <br>
                <mark>cellspacing </mark> <br>
                This attribute defines the size of the space between two cells in a percentage value or pixels. The attribute is applied both horizontally and vertically, to the space between the top of the table and the cells of the first row, the left of the table and the first column, the right of the table and the last column and the bottom of the table and the last row. <br>
                Usage note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. The "table" element should be styled using CSS. To create an effect similar to the cellspacing attribute, apply the border-spacing property to the "table" element. Border-spacing does not have any effect if border-collapse is set to collapse. <br>
                <mark>frame </mark> <br>
                This enumerated attribute defines which side of the frame surrounding the table must be displayed. It may have the following values: <br>
                <table style="width: 668px;">

                       </table>
                     
                Usage note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. The <table> element should be styled using CSS. To create an effect similar to the frame attribute, use the border-style and border-width properties. <br>
                <mark>rules </mark> <br>
                This enumerated attribute defines where rules, i.e. lines, should appear in a table. It can have the following values:
                <ul>
                    <li>none, which indicates that no rules will be displayed; it is the default value;</li>
                    <li>groups, which will cause the rules to be displayed between row groups (defined by the "thead", "tbody" and "tfoot" elements) and between column groups (defined by the "col" and "colgroup" elements) only;</li>
                    <li>rows, which will cause the rules to be displayed between rows;</li>
                    <li>columns, which will cause the rules to be displayed between columns;</li>
                    <li>all, which will cause the rules to be displayed between rows and columns.</li>
                </ul>
                Note: <br>
                The styling of the rules is browser-dependant and cannot be modified.
                Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. The rules should be defined and styled using CSS. Apply the border property to the appropriate "thead", "tbody", "tfoot", "col" or "colgroup" elements. <br>
                <mark>summary </mark> <br>
                This attribute defines an alternative text that summarizes the content of the table. Typically, it allows visually impaired people who are browsing the web with a Braille screen, to acquire information about the table. If the information added by this attribute is also useful to people who are not visually impaired, consider using the "caption" instead. The summary attribute is not mandatory and may be omitted when a "caption" element fulfills its role.
                Usage Note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. Instead, choose one of these methods to add a description of a table:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use prose around the table (this method is less semantic).</li>
                    <li>Add a description in the table's "caption" element.</li>
                    <li>Add a description in a "details" element, inside the table's "caption" element.</li>
                    <li>Include the "table" element in a "figure" element and add the description in prose next to it.</li>
                    <li>Include the "table" element in a "figure" element and add the description in prose inside a "figcaption" element.</li>
                    <li>Adjust the table so that a description is not needed (e.g. use "th" and "thead" elements).</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                
                
                
                 <br>
                <mark>width </mark> <br>
                This attribute defines the width of the table. The width may be defined by pixels or a percentage value. A percentage value will be defined by the width of the container in which the table is placed. <br>
                Usage Note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. The rules should be defined and styled using CSS. Use the width property instead.</td>
